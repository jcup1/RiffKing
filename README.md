# RiffKing
<h2>Theory:</h2>
    
  Riff King is an app for musicians. It allows you to share your youtube guitar videos.
  It's similar to youtube but I narrowed it down to guitar riffs. The biggest difference is ranking.
  This app will find the Riff King (TOP1 user) and show him on the top of the ranking list. 
  Maybe you won't be a rock star but you may be the Riff King. Yeah, this text sucks but I want to make this 
  app work properly before I start to write great descriptions.
  
<h2>Technically:</h2>
  
  I'm in the process of creating this app. It uses or will use things like: 
    
    -Firebase real-time database(like, views, comment, PM, etc...)
    -Firebase authorization (log in using Google)
    -Transactions
    -Drawer menu
    -Support offline usage
    -Glide/Picasso
    -CircularImageView
    -YoutubeAPI
    -Handling share option in other app
    -NestedScrollView, RecyclerView, tabs and so on...
     
   For now I stopped implementing it because of learning new things (check https://github.com/jcup1/MVPLearn5) 
   but for sure I will commit more here. 
     
   There are some bugs and I'm aware of that. The biggest issue is bad usage of Firebase database but now I know how to fix it.
