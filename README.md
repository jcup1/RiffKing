# RiffKing

This project is suspended. 

<h2>Theory:</h2>
    
  Riff King is an app for musicians. It allows you to share your youtube guitar videos.
  It's similar to youtube but I narrowed it down to guitar riffs. The biggest difference is ranking.
  This app will find the Riff King (TOP1 user) and show his name on the top of the ranking. 
  Maybe you won't be a rock star but you can always be the Riff King. Yeah, this text sucks. But I want to make this 
  app work properly before writing a great description.
  
<h2>Technically:</h2>
  
  I'm in the process of creating this app. It uses things like: 
    
    -Firebase real-time database(like, views, comment, PM, etc...)
    -Firebase authorization (log in using Google)
    -Transactions
    -Drawer menu
    -Support offline usage
    -Glide/Picasso
    -CircularImageView
    -YoutubeAPI
    -Handling share option in other app
    -NestedScrollView, RecyclerView, tabs and so on...
